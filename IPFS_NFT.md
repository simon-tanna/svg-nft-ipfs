# Steps for creating random SVG NFT

## What does it need to do?

- Upon minting NFT, Chainlink VRF will return a random number 1 - 5
- That number will get a random NFT from one of 5 monster types
- Chainlink VRF will return a random power level 1 - 100 for the monster
- User has to pay 15 monster coins to mint an NFT
- NFT metadata and image stored on IPFS and accessible in OpenSea

## What features can it have

- Can the contract owner withdraw the monster coins?
- Can we randomise colour attributes of monster NFT?
- Is there a max number of monsters that an address can mint per day/hour/week?
